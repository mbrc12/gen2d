# gen2d

A Leiningen template for Clojure2d drawings.
 
## Usage

Firstly clone this repo somewhere. Then just do

`$ lein install`

in the home directory of the project. This will install this template
to your system. Then you can just:

`$ lein new gen2d <name of project>`


# Thanks

This would be impossible without [clojure2d](https://github.com/Clojure2D/clojure2d),
and [fastmath](https://github.com/generateme/fastmath).
